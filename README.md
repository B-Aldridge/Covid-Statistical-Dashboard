Project 3 for Vanderbilt Data Analytics Bootcamp 2023
The code in this repository creates a website with multiple visualization tools for analyzing 
the relationships between COVID deaths and infections, and population density, country,
tourism, and vaccination within a country.

To run the code, please run the Dashboard/app.py file, which will lauch the website via Flask.
Prior to doing this, make sure that a MongoDB local server is running, and that
a "owid_covid_data" collection is present in the local database. This collection
can be imported into MongoDB from the databases/local.owid_covid_data.json

The root directory also contains the initial written proposal for this project ("Group1ProposalProject3.docx") and 
the original layout idea ("layout.pdf"). The final implementation has some differences with these original ideas
due to matters of feasibility, but generally addresses the original intent.
